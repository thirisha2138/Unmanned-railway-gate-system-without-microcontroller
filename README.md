# Unmanned-railway-gate-system-without-microcontroller
This experiment is to create a unmanned railway gate system without using Arduino Uno. The  “unmanned Railway Gate system ” is basically a smart automatic barrier that allows the traffic to  cross the railway track when there is no train and blocks the traffic when a train passes through  tracks.
